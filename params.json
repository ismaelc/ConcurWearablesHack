As an example, you can mash-up the Itinerary API with a restaurant database/API to provide recommendations of places to eat near a COncur user's hotel booking.\r\n\r\nThe Expense API (v3.0) allows you to get (and push) a Concur user's expense information, including expense line items, their types (e.g. food, lodging), totals, and even receipt images.\r\n\r\nHere's an example on how to get an Itinerary List of a Concur user:\r\n\r\n    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/travel/trip/v1.1\r\n    -H \"Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>\"\r\n    \r\nTo get an expense summary by using the Expense Report Digest API:\r\n\r\n    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/v3.0/expense/reportdigests\r\n    -H \"Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>\"\r\n    -H \"Accept: application/json\"\r\n    \r\n**To get an access token** (or learn how to generate one), please go to the Concur booth or click [here]() to advance to the section below.\r\n\r\nYou can interact with the API using Swagger [here](https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html\"><img src=\"https://jfqcza.bn1.livefilestore.com/y2phbDjCiRKZp3Btneho4UncjWK46iv8GFhyKdTZ7xJJ9BCJ-JJiNrw7ieCenHdSGPgEZL0Tj7IYjGypUv61u3KdIrjj0dAUM35DjC3cPzLls0/Screen%20Shot%202014-05-31%20at%202.09.43%20PM.png?psid=1\" width=\"610px\" /></a>\r\n\r\nFor the Itinerary APIs (v1.1), full API documentation, and apps that use the APIs, please refer to:\r\n\r\n[https://developer.concur.com/get-started/webservices-overview](https://developer.concur.com/get-started/webservices-overview)\r\n\r\nIdeas for a Concur-powered business travel app:\r\n--\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://jfqcza.bn1.livefilestore.com/y2pW4OEzxTpguO8XL5IAIzNQ_CiRQbSVAYOnWeNd1IWvId3XAfM0jIy9OTT0UgbaIjdepBO1JjbtmXP7JU3J_tO1JkNh1UbcmbE_HElMGRvXoQ/Wearable%20World%20-%20AA%20Hack%20map.png?psid=1\" width=\"610px\"/>\r\n(Image above:  Floor plan of Wearable Travel Hackathon - Parking, Checkin, Security, Gate, Club)\r\n\r\nMash-up  | Idea\r\n------------- | -------------\r\n**Concur + smartwatch/ring**  | Use smartwatch/ring to confirm if Mastercard purchase line item should be sent to Concur as expense (or ignored if personal purchase); Display QR code to POS reader to send purchase as expense to Concur\r\n**Concur + beacons/indoor position**  | Use Concur user's expense history to push relevant proximity ads/recommendations; Determine walk-time to gate based on Itinerary info\r\n**Concur + credit/debit card**  | Use smartwatch/ring to confirm if Mastercard purchase line item should be sent to Concur as expense (or ignored if personal purchase)\r\n**Concur + parking** | User Concur itinerary info (hotel/flight booking) to find fastest route to parking\r\n**Concur + wifi service** | Identify if colleagues are on same flight and initiate chat session\r\n\r\nIncentives\r\n--\r\n\r\n- To be announced\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
