What can I do with Concur APIs?
--

The Travel/Itinerary API (v1.1) lets you access a Concur user's itinerary, including hotel/flight booking info.  As an example, you can mash-up the Itinerary API with a restaurant database/API to provide recommendations of places to eat near a COncur user's hotel booking.

The Expense API (v3.0) allows you to get (and push) a Concur user's expense information, including expense line items, their types (e.g. food, lodging), totals, and even receipt images.

Here's an example on how to get an Itinerary List of a Concur user:

    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/travel/trip/v1.1
    -H "Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>"
    
To get an expense summary by using the Expense Report Digest API:

    curl https://www.concursolutions.com/api/v3.0/expense/reportdigests
    -H "Authorization: OAuth <insert your access token here>"
    -H "Accept: application/json"
    
**To get an access token** (or learn how to generate one), please go to the Concur booth or click [here]() to advance to the section below.

You can interact with the API using Swagger [here](https://www.concursolutions.com/api/docs/index.html)
